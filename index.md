## My parkrun Picture

I went to do the last parkrun without any desire. I felt really unmotivated. Then I said to my husband: 'no quiero ir' 
he replied '¿cuándo quieres?'... 

I continue being sat for a while, meditating the reasoning of his reply... it was true, it is hard to do things out of discipline...
Anyway I though that I now have the capability of doing it, I have done the 5k multiple times now, and it was just getting ready and go... 
Then, I went, stil hard, difficult, but doable. 
It was my second best time and increasing my history of doing it. 
I met my friends and the day was a good one, just because I force/push a bit more
